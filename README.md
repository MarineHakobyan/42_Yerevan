## Get_next_line: Efficient multi-file implementation

This project tackles reading lines from any file descriptor, efficiently managing multiple files and diverse inputs. Memory and buffers are meticulously handled to avoid overflows, even in edge cases.

**Features:**

* Reads lines from any file descriptor
* Handles empty/large files and null input
* Supports embedded newlines
* Optimizes memory with a static array

**Implementation:**

* Configurable buffer size (BUFFER_SIZE)
* Data chunked into buffers, appended to file-specific arrays
* First line extracted, remaining content updated efficiently
* Leftover content handled seamlessly

**Contribution:**

Demonstrates strong understanding of memory, buffers, and efficient file reading. Further testing recommended, but implementation addresses potential issues.

## push_swap: Efficient Integer Sorting Using Stacks

This project implements a highly optimized integer sorting algorithm, push_swap, utilizing stacks and leveraging the butterfly sort technique.

**Key Features:**

* Sorts any set of integers using only two stacks and a limited instruction set.
* Optimizes sorting based on the stack size, employing variations of the butterfly sort.
* Achieves efficient memory and buffer management, preventing overflows even in edge cases.

**Key Points:**

* Two stacks, A and B, play a crucial role in the sorting process.
* Divides and conquers approach by strategically moving elements between the stacks.
* Optimizes sorting based on the stack size to achieve superior performance.
* Employs a customized butterfly sort variation for sorting larger stacks efficiently.
* Relies on dedicated stack manipulation functions to accomplish sorting operations.

## ft_printf: Format Anything, Your Way

ft_printf lets you print any data - text, numbers, and more - just like the standard printf function. But it's built from scratch, giving you a deeper understanding of how formatting works.

**Key Features:**

* Works with different data types (text, numbers, etc.)
* Controls how things are displayed (alignment, spacing, etc.)
* Handles any number of additional values you give it
* Prints to the screen or to a file you choose

**Benefits:**

* Learn more about formatting and printf
* Understand how programs manage data and flow
* Get better at handling text and numbers in code
* Build a foundation for more complex printing functions

**Note:** This description assumes you have the code used for debugging ft_printf.

**Bonus:** Add even more data types, handle international formats, and improve performance for large amounts of data!
